                                The more mistakes you make, the faster you’ll learn and improve your photography skills. All professional photographers once started without an understanding of anything on a camera.
                                The real value is in turning mistakes into lessons that build your skills. So try a technique or style you haven’t done before and expect to make many mistakes along the way.

                                <h4>&#9775; Which Lenses Should You Use and When</h4>
                                There is no one lens that is appropriate for every type of photography or shooting situation.
                                This is why it’s a good idea to buy your camera body and your lenses separately. The kit lens that comes with your camera is usually not the best quality. And it will not always be suitable for the kind of photography you want to do. Especially if you’re aiming to take more professional pictures.

                                <h4>&#9775; Using Aperture to Control the Depth of Field</h4>
                                Aperture is a regulator that controls the flow of light through the lens. But aperture also affects your depth-of-field. Depth-of-field refers to the area of acceptable sharpness in a photograph. Aperture controls how shallow or deep the zone of acceptable sharpness is.
                                Smaller apertures (higher f-number) produce greater depth-of-field. Larger apertures (lower f-number) produce shallower depth-of-field. The size of the image sensor, the focal length of the lens, and the aperture all affect the depth-of-field.

                                <h4>&#9775; What to Do About Digital Noise</h4>
                                ISO is part of the Exposure Triangle. It affects how sensitive your camera is to light. As you increase your ISO, your image will become brighter.
                                But with that brightness comes an increase in noise.
                                Digital cameras are much better at handling noise than they used to be. Many digital cameras go up to ISO 6400. At what point you start to see significant noise will depend on your camera. Use a fast shutter speed and a smaller aperture like F8 or F11 so you get sharp images.

                                <h4>&#9775; Which Rules of Composition Should You Use</h4>
                                A simple concept to get you started is the “Rule-of-Thirds“.
                                This is a compositional principle that divides an image into nine equal sections. It does so by using two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.
                                The important elements in the scene fall along these lines. They can also fall at the points where the lines intersect. The Rule-of-Thirds is a great starting point, especially for certain genres like landscape.
                                There are other compositional principles that are even more powerful though. Check out the Phi Grid and Fibonacci Spiral.

                                <h4>&#9775; Fill Shadows With Reflectors</h4>
                                Fill light refers to the amount of light that is bounced back onto your subject. It is used to eliminate or soften shadows caused by the main light source. This is how you control contrast.
                                Changing the direction and intensity of your shadows can create a variety of lighting scenarios.
                                How you work with the shadows in your images can set your work apart from other photographers’.
                                Professional reflector kits are foldable discs. They come in gold, silver, white or black. You can use them interchangeably, depending on your lighting scenario.
